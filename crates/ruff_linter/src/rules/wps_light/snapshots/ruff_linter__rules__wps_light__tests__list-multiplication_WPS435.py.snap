WPS435.py:3:15: WPS435 Multiplication of list of mutable objects
  |
1 | # Example 1: Multiplying a list of mutable strings
2 | row = [""] * 3  # Creates a list with 3 references to the same empty string
3 | tic_tac_toe = [row] * 3  # This will create 3 references to the same `row` list
  |               ^^^^^^^^^ WPS435
4 | tic_tac_toe[0][0] = 'X'  # This affects all rows because they refer to the same `row` list
